      "description": "GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) refers to satellite systems such as GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou working together to provide precise global positioning, speed, and timing data. With RTK and PPP technologies, centimeter-level accuracy can be achieved. GNSS plays a critical role in construction, surveying, agriculture, mining, maritime operations, transportation, smart city applications, and autonomous systems. GNSS receivers deliver reliable data even in harsh field conditions, with real-time data transfer, high satellite tracking capacity, and durable designs for both mobile and fixed applications."

      "summary": "Railway systems are the cornerstone of modern transportation and the backbone of national logistics strategies. From high-speed rail lines to metro systems, light rail to commuter lines, every level of infrastructure is shaped by the need for safe, uninterrupted, and long-term operation. These infrastructures are constantly at risk due to both natural factors (ground movement, precipitation, temperature changes) and artificial effects (heavy traffic loads, construction activities, aging structural elements). Therefore, comprehensive and continuous monitoring of railway infrastructure is critical not only for maintenance planning, but also for passenger safety, environmental risk management, and legal compliance. Senceive’s wireless sensor systems are state-of-the-art solutions developed to meet these challenges. With real-time monitoring, automatic alarm notifications, remote access for intervention, and long-term data archiving capabilities, they offer railway engineers unlimited control.",
      "overview": "The safety and performance of rail systems are not only related to the track itself but also to surrounding structures, geotechnical conditions, and even seasonal variations. Traditional monitoring methods usually provide periodic measurements instead of real-time data, making early warning systems insufficient. Yet, issues like track deformation, tunnel segment separation, or sudden slope changes in switch systems can pose major risks even with a few minutes of delay. This is where Senceive steps in: low-power wireless sensor nodes, connected to each other, measure parameters such as tilt, displacement, temperature, and strain simultaneously and transmit them to the cloud via gateways. The system provides maximum data access with minimal human intervention across all types of rail structures, from metro tunnels to high-speed lines. Users can analyze measurement results through advanced visualization interfaces, define threshold values, and set up automatic alarms based on specific scenarios. This creates a proactive rather than reactive maintenance model. Moreover, the system is compatible with existing infrastructure through integration with SCADA systems and third-party software. Designed to operate reliably even in harsh environments such as high humidity, intense electromagnetic fields, or narrow spaces, the system has an IP68+ protection rating and marks a new era in railway engineering.",
      "howItWorks": {
        "description": "Senceive’s rail monitoring solutions operate through the integration of a multi-layer sensor network, energy management infrastructure, and a cloud-based software platform. Each monitoring point features sensor nodes (tilt, displacement, temperature, strain) with IP68-rated enclosures suitable for harsh field conditions. These sensors can be installed on rails, sleepers, switch boxes, or retaining walls within minutes. They collect data at defined intervals (e.g., every minute) and transmit it via LoRa, GSM, or RF to gateways. The gateways then send the data to secure, always-on cloud servers. Users access this data through Senceive's Insight platform, which provides multi-graph views, comparative analytics, real-time sensor tracking, and alarm notifications via email/SMS. Automated actions can also be defined for specific events (e.g., when a sensor threshold is exceeded), such as data sharing, third-party system integration (e.g., SCADA, GIS), or triggering video recording. Thanks to solar-powered gateways, the system can operate continuously for years in mountainous, rural, or tunnel environments without the need for external power. Depending on measurement frequency and environmental conditions, battery life ranges from 8 to 15 years. Maintenance needs are minimal, and the system can be updated remotely, including firmware updates. This allows new features to be added or network management to be optimized without going on-site.",

Among the greatest challenges faced during these operations are ground instability, sudden deformations from blasting activities, roof collapses, landslides, weakening of tailings dams, and structural damage. Senceive’s wireless monitoring systems are specifically designed for these dynamic and hazardous environments. Robust sensor nodes monitor the behavior of critical structures in mining sites with millimetric precision. They collect real-time data particularly from slopes, tunnels, shafts, and dams. This enhances worker safety and maximizes operational efficiency. Thanks to remote access to field data, a continuous flow of information is maintained between engineers and field teams. Senceive solutions reduce maintenance costs, minimize downtime, and help prevent potential disasters. Moreover, with solar-powered gateways, reliable long-term monitoring is possible even without energy infrastructure.",

They can simultaneously monitor parameters such as slope stability, surface movements, tunnel deformations, convergence movements, and tailings dam pressure variations. Moreover, since these systems operate over LoRa, RF, or GSM connections, they provide uninterrupted communication even in sites spanning large areas. The Insight platform processes all incoming data in real time, generating meaningful graphs, comparative analyses, and alert systems.

        "description": "Senceive’s infrastructure monitoring solutions are based on an integrated system consisting of sensor nodes, gateway devices, and a data management platform. Each sensor node is equipped with high-precision hardware capable of measuring parameters such as tilt, displacement, temperature, and strain. Manufactured to IP68 standards, these sensors are built to function for years even in harsh field conditions. They can be installed within minutes in predefined areas (e.g., bridge piers, tunnel walls, dam faces). Once installed, the sensors collect data at set intervals and wirelessly transmit it to the nearest gateway. These gateways typically operate on solar power and transmit the data to the cloud-based Insight platform via LoRaWAN, GSM, or RF communication. The platform visualizes this data through time-based graphs, detects anomalies, and generates alerts when necessary. Users can define threshold values and set up automatic integration with SCADA or other systems. The system can also be updated remotely, allowing new sensor types or data algorithms to be introduced without physical site intervention. With minimal maintenance requirements, the system can operate continuously for over 10 years.",

      "paragraphs": [
        "Benewake sensors are high-precision distance measurement systems that operate using ToF (Time-of-Flight) technology. The sensor emits an infrared laser beam toward a target; the beam reflects off the target surface and returns, and the round-trip time is measured to calculate the distance with millimeter-level precision.",
        "This principle enables the sensors to perform tasks with high accuracy such as fixed height tracking, terrain monitoring, and landing-takeoff control in drone systems. In robotic platforms, they provide direct input for obstacle detection and navigation. In autonomous vehicles, they contribute to collision avoidance and object recognition. In building automation, they are used for floor positioning, vehicle presence, and human motion detection.",
        "Benewake sensors, with their compact design, low power consumption, IP protection rating, and various communication interfaces (UART, CAN, RS485), can be easily integrated into different systems. This makes them an ideal and long-lasting solution for applications ranging from mobile platforms to industrial automation."
